Ugandan academic detained for likening President Yoweri Museveni to a person&#8217;s bottom fears authorities are trying to have her declared insane to lock her up in a psychiatric facility.Stella Nyanzi, a research fellow at Uganda&#8217;s Makerere University, was charged with &#8220;cyber-harassment&#8221; for referring to Museveni as &#8220;a pair of buttocks&#8221; in one of her Facebook posts, according to court documents.Nyanzi&#8217;s lawyer, Nicholas Opiyo, said on Thursday she told him two men presenting themsleves as doctors tried to trick her into taking a psychiatric test a day earlier. The two were from a government mental hospital, he claimed.&#8220;They [the government] do not want to go to trial,&#8221; Opiyo said. &#8220;They just want to delegitimise Stella, characterise her as a fool, a mad person ... and confine her to a mental hospital.&#8221;At her court hearing on Monday, Nyanzi had objected to prosecutors&#8217; request for an evaluation of her mental health.Frank Baine, a spokesman for the Uganda Prisons department, denied the two men who visited Nyanzi were mental health specialists. The medical exam was &#8220;a routine medical exam that every new inmate undergoes to avoid risks of spreading infection&#8221;, he said.In Uganda mental health examinations are usually reserved for suspects accused of crimes such as statutory rape.Nyanzi, a mother of three, remains in custody pending a bail hearing. She has denied the charges but said she often writes metaphorically &#8220;to speak truth to power&#8221;.She is popular on Facebook for her relentless criticism of Museveni, 72, who has ruled Uganda since 1986.New York-based Human Rights Watch said Nyanzi&#8217;s arrest and prosecution was an &#8220;indicator that those who express critical views of the Ugandan government, especially the first family, can face its wrath&#8221;.Museveni secured his latest term in office last year in a poll that independent monitors said lacked credibility and transparency.Some Ugandan politicians have been recently saying they would back a proposal to remove the age limit from the country&#8217;s constitution, the last obstacle to a possible life presidency for Museveni. -&nbsp;Al Jazeera
