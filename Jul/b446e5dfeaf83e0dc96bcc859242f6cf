Angola has rejected conditions demanded by an EU election observer mission that had been preparing to witness next month&#8217;s polls in the country, state media reported Monday.The European team had called for unfettered access to polling stations across the vast southern African nation during the August 23 vote.&#8220;So this is Africa. And we do not expect anyone to impose on us their means of observing elections or to give lectures,&#8221; said Foreign Minister Georges Chicoti according to the Journal de Angola newspaper.READ MORE: The African elections you need to keep an eye on in 2017&#8220;The invitation stands. But we do not want to have separate agreements with all of the organisations (sending observers).&#8221;Chicoti added that the only organisations with which Angola has election observation deals were the African Union and the southern African bloc SADC.&#8220;These are the only institutions for which Angola must abide by the electoral processes laid down in law,&#8221; he said.The foreign ministry warned that safety could be an issue if the EU observers were allowed unhindered access to polling stations in all 18 of Angola&#8217;s provinces.&#8220;The European Union has not yet decided whether it will send an observer mission or not,&#8221; said the EU mission&#8217;s spokesman Pablo Mazarrasa.President Eduardo Jose Dos Santos who has ruled Angola since 1979 will not contest next month&#8217;s general election, marking a historic change in the oil-rich country.In February, the ruling MPLA named Jose Lourenco, currently defence minister, as Dos Santos&#8217; successor and he is most likely to succeed him after the August election.Although Angola is one of the largest producers of oil in sub-Saharan Africa, it remains one of the poorest countries on the continent.str-bed-gw/pg&copy; Agence France-Presse
