An official charged with overseeing IT in Kenya&#8217;s election commission was found dead just over a week before the country goes to the polls, the commission&#8217;s chairman said Monday.The body of Chris Msando, a top information technology manager at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), has been identified at the city morgue, according to IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati.&#8220;There was no doubt he was tortured and murdered. The only question in our mind is who (killed him) and why he was killed a few days to elections,&#8221; Chebukati told reporters.In an earlier statement, Chebukati said Msando was last seen Friday night and sent a text message to a colleague early Saturday morning suggesting &#8220;that he was conscious and fully aware of his itinerary for that day&#8221;.A mortuary employee said Msando&#8217;s body was brought in by police on Saturday, but the reason for the 48-hour delay between his body&#8217;s arrival and its identification by family members on Monday remains unclear.The IEBC is administering Kenya&#8217;s August 8 election, which is expected to be a tight race between President Uhuru Kenyatta and longtime opposition leader Raila Odinga.Both sides have accused the other of underhanded tactics in the run-up to the polls, with the president saying Odinga is trying to divide the nation and provoke violence, and the opposition leader claiming Kenyatta plans to rig the poll.&copy; Agence France-Presse
