Why a Nigerian mother was inspired to create a YouTube channel&#8220;You really need a medical personnel, a trained Doctor to clerk you, examine and then maybe do some test to be able to say okay this person is having a kind of chronic typhoid which has perforated his intestines. That can be an emergency, it an emergency because it can lead to septicaemia, many other things. So talking about going online to seek for medical attention, its quote unquote good but it can be very harmfully too,&#8221; said Dr. Divine.&#8220;The challenges come as poverty, lack of information, lack of infrastructure because even if someone in the village is informed about what is going on in their body, they know what they should do what they should not do, if they need professional care they would have to leave from that village, sometimes to go somewhere else because the infrastructure is not there. And even when that health care is in the neighbouring urban setting, they might not even have the road,&#8221; said Dr. Sea.Dr. Sea also holds seminars and trains doctors for free whenever she visits the country. She recently gave a talk on non-communicable diseases attended by a number of health practitioners. The doctor also has a webpage where she posts health articles; she says her work targets not only people in Cameroon but in West Africa as well.&#8220;My favourite video is that on antibiotics resistance. Why&#8212;is because antibiotics resistance is something that many people don&#8217;t know about. It&#8217;s something that, it&#8217;s a silent killer that keeps rising and none of us know about it,&#8221; said Njang Emmanuel, a Buea resident.&#8220;I&#8217;m of the opinion that it is something&#8230; most of the alumni network of Doctors who have left the country can contribute to and through an initiative such as this they can make great impact,&#8221; said Monique Kwachou another Buea resident.Dr. Sea is working on plans to start filming videos in Hausa and Swahili, to educate more people and help address a shortage of doctors and other health practitioners on the continent.
