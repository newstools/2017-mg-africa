Three journalists who tried to get a closer look at Botswana President Ian Khama&#8217;s holiday home last week were allegedly detained and threatened by plain clothes security agents, according to a local NGO. The Ink Centre for Investigative Journalism, which is based in Gaborone, says the three were briefly held on Wednesday after they travelled to investigate &#8220;unexplained developments at President Ian Khama&#8217;s holiday home near Mosu village&#8221;, around 600km northeast of the capital. &#8220;Seven armed plain clothes security agents on quad bikes and SUVs barred the journalists near Mosu village&hellip; and warned them never to &#8216;set foot&#8217; near President Ian Khama&#8217;s private compound or risk death,&#8221; said the centre in a statement. Private radio station GabzFM claimed the journalists had been following up on reports &#8220;suggesting that the military and other government agencies are alleged to be constructing a multi-million pula compound for Khama using tax payers&#8217; money&#8221;. Khama&#8217;s closely-guarded compound at Mosu appears to be a sensitive subject in Botswana. &nbsp; The Botswana Guardian reported in 2013 that Khama &#8220;settled&#8221; in Mosu in late 2000, using a luxurious caravan as temporary accommodation before being allocated land to construct a lodge and an airstrip. &nbsp; The Ink Centre for Investigative Journalism claimed that Wednesday&#8217;s incident &#8220;was part of a growing pattern of official harassment of the private media in Botswana&#8221;. The centre&#8217;s co-founder Joel Konopo was one of the three reporters who say they were detained. He told the US-based Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project that the reporters had been able to call a lawyer and identify the men as intelligence agents using the numberplates of the vehicles they were driving. &ndash; News24
